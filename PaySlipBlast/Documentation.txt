Create a credentials.json key
To obtain the `credentials.json` file required for accessing Google Sheets via API, you'll need to create a project in the Google Developers Console and generate credentials for that project. Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Create a Project:**
   - Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Click on "Select a project" at the top of the page and then click on the "New Project" button.
   - Give your project a name and click "Create".

2. **Enable Google Sheets API:**
   - In the dashboard, select your project (the one you just created).
   - In the left sidebar menu, click on "Enable APIs and Services".
   - Search for "Google Sheets API" and click on it.
   - Click the "Enable" button.

3. **Create Service Account Credentials:**
   - Still in the dashboard, go to "Credentials" in the left sidebar.
   - Click on "Create credentials" and select "Service account".
   - Fill out the necessary information for your service account.
   - Under "Role", assign the service account the role of "Project" -> "Editor" or any relevant permissions based on your needs.
   - Click "Continue" and then "Done".

4. **Generate and Download Credentials:**
   - Find your newly created service account in the "Service Accounts" section under "Credentials".
   - Click on your service account email.
   - Navigate to the "Keys" tab and click on "Add Key" -> "Create new key".
   - Choose the JSON key type and click "Create". This will download a JSON file containing your credentials (`credentials.json`).

5. **Use `credentials.json` in your Python code:**
   - Place the downloaded `credentials.json` file in the directory where you're running your Python script.
   - Modify the Python script shared earlier, replacing `'credentials.json'` with the correct path to your downloaded credentials file.

By following these steps, you'll obtain the `credentials.json` file required to authenticate and access Google Sheets through the Google Sheets API in your Python code.
